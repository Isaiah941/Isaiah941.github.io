		This page will show all the music recordings that I've created and that I consider official. <br>
		I currently don't have any major projects done, but I am planning to (at some point.)<br>
		This page is in order of release date, with the most recent on the top and the oldest on the bottom.<br>

				<a href= "albums/isaiahmayer">"Isaiah Mayer" (Unfinished Album)</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once released, this will be my debut album, with at least 3 songs written by me, likely more.

				<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gARonvvYZA">"As The World Falls Down" (3:41)</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a mediocre David Bowie cover that was going to be part of my album, but I decided against it.<br>
				I don't like my execution of this, but I really like the arrangement.<br>
				It starts in F# Major, but moves to the major flat 6th and then into A major.<br>
